About Juice Labs

Juice Labs LLC develops software and digital tools, including blockchain-based applications, digital asset operations, and experimental technology projects. The studio focuses on building secure, user-friendly interfaces that make on-chain experiences more approachable, transparent, and fun.

The Juice is one of our flagship experiments: a simple, non-custodial challenge and escrow tool that lets participants lock funds into a smart contract and submit outcomes on-chain. Our goal is to explore how peer-to-peer coordination, transparent rules, and smart contracts can be used to create new types of digital experiences.

Juice Labs operates as a lean, experiment-first software studio. We iterate in public, ship small, and treat everything we build as a live, evolving prototype. Nothing we ship is financial, legal, or gambling advice — it’s software for people who want to explore what’s possible with digital assets and modern blockchain networks.
