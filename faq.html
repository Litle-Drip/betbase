### What is The Juice?

The Juice is an experimental, on-chain challenge / escrow tool built by Juice Labs LLC. It lets two participants lock funds into a smart contract and then submit outcomes to release or refund funds based on the result.

### Is this a sportsbook or casino?

No. The Juice does not set odds, take positions against users, or act as a traditional sportsbook or casino. It is a peer-to-peer escrow and outcome-voting tool. You are responsible for how and where you use it, and for complying with your local laws.

### What network does it run on?

The current version of The Juice runs on the Base network and uses self-custodial wallets like MetaMask to sign transactions.

### Who controls my funds?

You do. The Juice is non-custodial. Funds are held in smart contracts you interact with directly from your wallet. Juice Labs LLC does not have access to your private keys.

### Are there protocol fees?

Yes. Some interactions may charge a protocol fee that is sent to a designated treasury address. The fee logic is encoded in the smart contract and may be displayed in the interface. Always review transaction details before approving.

### What happens if there’s a bug or exploit?

Because The Juice is experimental software deployed on a public blockchain, bugs or vulnerabilities can cause permanent loss of funds. There is no guarantee of recovery. Only use funds you can afford to lose.

### Is using The Juice legal in my country/state?

We cannot provide legal advice. Laws around digital assets, contests, and wagering vary widely by jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with the laws that apply to you.

### Do you store my personal information?

We aim to collect as little information as possible. We may see wallet addresses and on-chain activity, plus basic web analytics. See our Privacy Policy for details.
