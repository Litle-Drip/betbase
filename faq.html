    ❓ What is The Juice?

The Juice is an experimental, on-chain challenge / escrow tool built by Edison Labs LLC. It lets two participants lock funds into a smart contract and then submit outcomes to release or refund funds based on the result.

    ❓ Is this a sportsbook or casino?

No. The Juice does not set odds, take positions against users, or act as a traditional sportsbook or casino. It is a peer-to-peer escrow and outcome-voting tool. You are responsible for how and where you use it, and for complying with your local laws.

    ❓ What network does it run on?

The current version of The Juice runs on the Base network and uses self-custodial wallets like MetaMask to sign transactions.

    ❓ Who controls my funds?

You do. The Juice is non-custodial. Funds are held in smart contracts you interact with directly from your wallet. Edison Labs LLC does not have access to your private keys.

    ❓ Are there protocol fees?

Yes. Some interactions may charge a protocol fee that is sent to a designated treasury address. The fee logic is encoded in the smart contract and may be displayed in the interface. Always review transaction details before approving.

    ❓ What happens if there’s a bug or exploit?

Because The Juice is experimental software deployed on a public blockchain, bugs or vulnerabilities can cause permanent loss of funds. There is no guarantee of recovery. Only use funds you can afford to lose.

    ❓ Is using The Juice legal in my country/state?

We cannot provide legal advice. Laws around digital assets, contests, and wagering vary widely by jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with the laws that apply to you.

    ❓ Do you store my personal information?

We aim to collect as little information as possible. We may see wallet addresses and on-chain activity, plus basic web analytics. See our Privacy Policy for details.

    ❓ Who is behind Edison Labs?

Edison Labs LLC is a small software development and innovation studio focused on blockchain-based applications, digital asset operations, and experimental technology projects.

    ❓ How do challenges get resolved?

A challenge resolves when both players submit their vote.
* If both votes match, the contract automatically pays the winner.
* Both vote the same → instant payout
* Both vote differently → full refunds after the deadline
* Only one votes → challenge cannot finish
* No one votes → challenge cannot finish

    ❓ Can I change my vote after submitting it?
No. Votes are permanent once submitted, and cannot be edited or undone. This prevents cheating or manipulation.

Make sure to vote carefully.

    ❓ Can stuck funds be fixed?

Not in this version. Once a challenge becomes stuck due to missing votes:
No payout path exists
No refund path exists
The on-chain rules prevent the contract from sending funds back
This is why it’s important to challenge reliable players.
