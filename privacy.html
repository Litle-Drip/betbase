This Privacy Policy explains how Juice Labs LLC (“Juice Labs”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information in connection with thejuiceapp.io and related services (the “Service”).

1. Information We Collect

We aim to collect as little personal information as reasonably possible.

a) Information you provide directly  
- Contact information if you email us or fill out a form (e.g., name, email, message content).

b) Information collected automatically  
- Standard web logs (IP address, browser type, pages viewed, timestamps).
- Device and usage information (e.g., referring URLs, approximate location based on IP).
- If enabled, aggregated analytics data from third-party tools (e.g., page views, session duration).

c) Blockchain and wallet data  
When you connect a wallet or interact with smart contracts:
- We may see your public wallet address and transaction details on-chain.
- We do not control or store your private keys.

2. How We Use Information

We use collected information to:
- operate, maintain, and improve the Service,
- understand usage patterns and performance,
- communicate with you if you contact us,
- detect, prevent, or investigate potential abuse or security issues,
- comply with legal obligations when required.

We do not sell your personal data.

3. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We may use cookies or similar technologies to:
- remember basic preferences,
- perform analytics, or
- improve the user experience.

You can usually control cookies through your browser settings.

4. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party providers for:
- analytics,
- error tracking,
- infrastructure (e.g., hosting, RPC providers).

These providers may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies.

5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information we control. However:
- no system is perfectly secure,
- blockchain transactions are public and irrevocable,
- transmission of data over the internet carries inherent risks.

6. Your Choices

You may:
- choose not to provide certain information (though this may limit some features),
- configure cookie or tracking preferences in your browser,
- disconnect your wallet at any time.

7. Children’s Privacy

The Service is not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Service means you accept the updated Policy.
