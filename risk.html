Using The Juice and related tools from Juice Labs LLC involves significant risks. By interacting with our website, smart contracts, or any associated services, you acknowledge and accept the following:

1. Digital Asset Risk  
Digital assets are highly volatile and may lose some or all of their value. You should not use funds you cannot afford to lose.

2. Smart Contract & Technical Risk  
Smart contracts are experimental software. They may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or behave in unexpected ways. Interacting with them can lead to permanent loss of funds.

3. Irreversible Transactions  
Blockchain transactions are generally irreversible. Once a transaction is broadcast and confirmed, it cannot be undone, reversed, or forcibly refunded.

4. Network & Infrastructure Risk  
Congestion, forks, failed transactions, RPC outages, or chain-level issues can impact your experience and may lead to stuck, delayed, or more expensive transactions.

5. Legal & Regulatory Risk  
Rules related to digital assets, contests, and wagering differ by jurisdiction and may change over time. You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with laws that apply to you.

6. No Guarantees or Insurance  
There is no guarantee of uptime, availability, performance, or security. There is no insurance or guaranteed recovery if funds are lost.

By using The Juice or any tool operated by Juice Labs LLC, you agree that you understand these risks and are using the Service entirely at your own risk and discretion.
